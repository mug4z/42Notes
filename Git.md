## The perfect commit

- Combine change of the same topic in a single commit.
### The perfect commit message
Tips: If you have issue to write an subject concisly maybe it's because you add too much of different topic.
1. Subject = concise summary of what happened.
2. Body = more detailed explanation 
	1. What is now different than before ?
	2. WHat's the reason for the change ?
	3. Is there anything to watch outn for / anything particularly remarkable ?
### Command

`git add file ` -> add file to commit.
`git add -p file` -> add modified part of a file.
`git commit`
	- The first line is the subject
	- Then after an empty line this is considered as the body
