- [x] function template easyfind
	- [x] Take two parameters, one type T and an integer
	- [x] const version of template function.
- [x] Does all the sequencials containers have begin and end 
	- [x] vector
	- [x] list 
	- [x] deque
## Objective
- [x] Assuming T is a container of integers, this function has to find the first occurrence of the second parameter in the first parameter.

# Ex01

- [x] Span class
	- [x] Store a max of N integers ( N is an unsigned int)
- [x] addNumber function
	- [x] add a single number to the span
	- [x] if an attempt to add a new element if there are already N element stored should throw an exception.
- [x] shortestSpan
	- [x] throw an exception if there are only or no number
	- [x] find the shortestspan between the numbers.
- [x] longestSpan
	- [x] throw an exception if there are only or no number
	- [x] find the longestspan between the numbers.
- [x] bigFill
	- [x] use a range of iteraotr to fill the span in one call.
- [ ] Verifier avec des const toute les operations possible.
