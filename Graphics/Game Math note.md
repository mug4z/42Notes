# Chapter 1 Cartesian Coordinate Systems
Real numbers :
1. Rational number -> 1/2
2. Integers : 1 , 2, 3, 5 .. -1 -2 -3

**The study of natural numbers and integers is called _discrete mathematics_, and the study of real numbers is called _continuous mathematics_.**

**The First Law of Computer Graphics**
**If it _looks_ right, it _is_ right.**

 No matter what orientation we choose for the  𝑥- and  𝑦 -axes, we can always rotate the coordinate space around so that  +𝑥 points to our right and  +𝑦 points up.

(x,y) -> Are 2D Cartesian coordinates. 


## 3D Cartesian
- Add a z axis.
- In 3D, any pair of axes **defines a plane** that contains the two axes and is perpendicular to the third axis.
- The x y axis in 2D are not the same in 3D.
- All 3D coordinate spaces are not equal, in the sense that some pairs of coordinate systems cannot be rotated to line up with each other

- There are exactly two distinct types of 3D coordinate spaces: _left-handed_ coordinate spaces and _right-handed_ coordinate spaces. If two coordinate spaces have the same handedness, then they can be rotated such that the axes are aligned. If they are of opposite handedness, then this is not possible.
- **An axis of rotation can be arbitrarily oriented.**

## Convention used in the book
- Left-hand coordinate
- summation notation.
